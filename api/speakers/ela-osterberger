She moved to the UK 5 years ago to support the yellow pages as they evolved their business to an online/social media model for their European audience. Subsequently she worked for the Omnicom Media Group working with a range of clients including Harrods, Mondelez, Waitrose and Virgin Media, helping them get a better understanding of their audience.</p>\r\n<p>She is now focusing on devising and implementing a relationship strategy for the Guardian. In practise she spends much of her time, supported by her team, querying and gathering insight from web datasets with billions of rows, analysing at the most granular level how users interact with the Guardian&rsquo;s digital products. They work very closely with UX, Data Science, Data Technology and developers to inform editorial and product decisions. She also enjoys baking cakes.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaosterberger?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=rAEo&amp;locale=fr_FR&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A74344584%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1485948422222%2Ctas%3Aela%20os\">LinkedIn</a></p>","company":"The Guardian ","company_role":"Head of Audience Data and Insight ","company_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/international","country_long":"London, UK","country_short":"UK","order":11,"images":[{"public_id":"pcua3dupkyy3ehpqlfym","version":1499874457,"signature":"7e8ca65f97cb279172385c1ebfbf15772c2b7744","width":1434,"height":958,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/pcua3dupkyy3ehpqlfym.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/pcua3dupkyy3ehpqlfym.jpg","_id":"5966449aae536f3c780def69"},{"public_id":"bld4bed90iaaopsho0gl","version":1499874457,"signature":"b8b225dab02ec9baca006b840caa7e61cf35e1a5","width":1434,"height":958,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/bld4bed90iaaopsho0gl.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/bld4bed90iaaopsho0gl.jpg","_id":"5966449aae536f3c780def68"},{"public_id":"znrq5etcpdkf6vmszgcu","version":1499874457,"signature":"fde86b1e345cb5623fbe7055c8494d5cf39a90fe","width":1434,"height":958,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/znrq5etcpdkf6vmszgcu.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/znrq5etcpdkf6vmszgcu.jpg","_id":"5966449aae536f3c780def67"},{"public_id":"wa9xoinha3i4thhcttmg","version":1499874457,"signature":"d09175992f5eabc0ae4b7006e04a482f55719ff3","width":1434,"height":958,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/wa9xoinha3i4thhcttmg.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/wa9xoinha3i4thhcttmg.jpg","_id":"5966449aae536f3c780def66"}],"image":{"public_id":"ebqku5a0wxmr8czogcvh","version":1496134257,"signature":"faf5644d0fb5601dc44e000971603e41c4f93733","width":1110,"height":670,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1496134257/ebqku5a0wxmr8czogcvh.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1496134257/ebqku5a0wxmr8czogcvh.jpg"}},"img":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1496134257/ebqku5a0wxmr8czogcvh.jpg","images":[{"public_id":"pcua3dupkyy3ehpqlfym","version":1499874457,"signature":"7e8ca65f97cb279172385c1ebfbf15772c2b7744","width":1434,"height":958,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/pcua3dupkyy3ehpqlfym.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/pcua3dupkyy3ehpqlfym.jpg","_id":"5966449aae536f3c780def69"},{"public_id":"bld4bed90iaaopsho0gl","version":1499874457,"signature":"b8b225dab02ec9baca006b840caa7e61cf35e1a5","width":1434,"height":958,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/bld4bed90iaaopsho0gl.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/bld4bed90iaaopsho0gl.jpg","_id":"5966449aae536f3c780def68"},{"public_id":"znrq5etcpdkf6vmszgcu","version":1499874457,"signature":"fde86b1e345cb5623fbe7055c8494d5cf39a90fe","width":1434,"height":958,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/znrq5etcpdkf6vmszgcu.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/znrq5etcpdkf6vmszgcu.jpg","_id":"5966449aae536f3c780def67"},{"public_id":"wa9xoinha3i4thhcttmg","version":1499874457,"signature":"d09175992f5eabc0ae4b7006e04a482f55719ff3","width":1434,"height":958,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/wa9xoinha3i4thhcttmg.jpg","secure_url":"/keystone-demo/image/upload/v1499874457/wa9xoinha3i4thhcttmg.jpg","_id":"5966449aae536f3c780def66"}],"events":[{"_id":"592d37a26ea701167472e14b","slug":"work-your-way-through-the-data-analytics-workflow","title":"Work Your Way Through the Data Analytics Workflow","__v":0,"categories":{"_id":"5922ab89df9c31daea253281","key":"workshop","name":"Workshop","__v":0},"speaker":"592d32316ea701167472e144","community_wall":[],"content":{"extended":"<p>The digital age has given rise to a vast amount of data, especially web analytics data that describes how users engage with our platforms online.

In this workshop we will look at the data analytics workflow &ndash; from the raw data to presenting key findings. We will cover data cleaning, examination, aggregation, and how to describe our data in simple statistical terms. We will discuss the best data visualizations for each data type and how to extract the most interesting and actionable findings.
