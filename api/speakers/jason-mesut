He has drawn on his experience studying industrial design,&nbsp;and his early years as a management consultant, to promote and practice&nbsp;various forms of design in leading agencies and consultancies around London. Through mostly long engagements with clients, he has realised the value of design, but still struggles with it every day.</p>\r\n<p>Jason has been an active member of the London UX community&nbsp;acting as a local leader for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/IxDA-London/\">IxDA London</a>&nbsp;for the past 5 years, running monthly events.
